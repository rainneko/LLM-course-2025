              "<p>The research article introduces VCode, a novel multimodal coding benchmark that redefines multimodal understanding as the generation of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) code from natural images. This approach emphasizes capturing symbolic visual meaning, similar to how humans reason over sketches, as an alternative to dense pixel-based representations. VCode repurposes existing benchmarks across commonsense, professional knowledge, and visual-centric perception domains. To evaluate symbolic fidelity, the authors propose CodeVQA, where a policy model answers questions based on the rendered SVG. Empirically, frontier Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate limitations in generating faithful SVGs. To address this, the paper presents VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs with iterative revision (thinking with revision) and external perception tools (acting with visual tools). VCoder achieves significant performance gains over strong baselines, yet human studies and experimental results highlight persistent challenges in bridging the gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding, particularly in complex domains like professional knowledge and 3D reasoning.</p>\n",

The task of faithful SVG generation from natural images is highly challenging for frontier VLMs, requiring management of long code contexts and precise low-level detail encoding, which currently limits their intrinsic capabilities. VCoder's reliance on external visual tools (e.g., object detectors, segmenters) highlights that VLMs currently lack the intrinsic fine-grained perception needed for detailed code generation, potentially limiting end-to-end learning. Models show particular struggle with domains requiring professional knowledge and 3D reasoning, suggesting limitations in abstract or complex spatial representation via SVG. The observation that converting images to linguistic captions *before* SVG generation often outperforms direct image-to-SVG approaches implies that language still acts as a critical intermediate representation, rather than models directly \"thinking\" in visual code.</td>\n",

              "  Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02243)**<br>This research introduces a novel framework for understanding how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) resolve conflicting information, decomposing \"modality following\" into case-specific relative reasoning uncertainty and a model's inherent modality preference. Through a carefully constructed controllable \"toy\" dataset that systematically varies visual and textual difficulty, the study empirically establishes a universal law: the probability of an MLLM following a specific modality monotonically decreases as its relative reasoning uncertainty increases. This allows for a principled quantification of a model's inherent preference as a \"balance point,\" effectively disentangling it from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts, a significant strength over prior coarse dataset-level statistics. Furthermore, the paper provides mechanistic insight by revealing that models exhibit internal \"oscillations\" between conflicting answers across layers when operating in ambiguous regions near this balance point, explaining observed external hesitation. While the use of a controlled \"toy\" dataset is crucial for isolating variables and revealing these fundamental principles, its simplicity, focusing primarily on color and attribution tasks, might limit the direct generalizability of the specific balance points or oscillation patterns to more complex, real-world multimodal scenarios or diverse reasoning tasks. Additionally, the reliance on output token entropy as a proxy for perceived uncertainty, while validated, may not capture all nuances of reasoning difficulty across diverse MLLM behaviors.\n",

This innovative approach makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent, even to non-experts, effectively bridging the critical gap between statistical performance and intuitive understanding of model capabilities. The benchmark features a comprehensive dual-path evaluation, assessing both spatial imagination (generation tasks) and perception (recognition tasks) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels. It successfully exposes a significant capability gap in even state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional language-spatial mappings crucial for genuine world understanding. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a promising avenue to investigate model similarity through stylistic characteristics of generated images.</td>\n",

The benchmark uses a relatively small dataset and focuses exclusively on spatial perception and imagination, which constrains the comprehensiveness and generalizability of its findings to a broader range of LLM abilities. This narrow scope means it does not yet provide a holistic evaluation of various other cognitive capacities. Additionally, the analysis of model similarity, while a promising exploratory direction, is still preliminary, relying on stylistic comparisons of generated images as a proxy rather than more systematic and quantitatively rigorous approaches. These factors suggest that while LTD-Bench is a valuable advancement, further expansion in dataset size, task diversity, and analytical methodology is essential for more robust and universally applicable insights into LLM spatial reasoning.</td>\n",

The research also highlights compelling emergent properties, including the model's capacity for unseen visual manipulations, autonomous switching between reasoning modes based on task complexity, and improved test-time scaling through diversified multimodal exploration. However, a weakness identified is that interleaved reasoning is not universally superior; for certain in-domain tasks like ChartQA, text-only reasoning slightly outperformed ThinkMorph, suggesting that visual input can sometimes be supplementary rather than essential. Additionally, test-time scaling on some perception-focused benchmarks exhibited a U-shaped pattern, initially declining before recovering, indicating that the benefits of diversified reasoning trajectories are not always consistently monotonic across all task types and might require larger sample sizes to fully manifest.<br><br>"

Experiments demonstrate OS-Sentinel's superior performance, achieving 10-30% improvements over existing rule-based and VLM-as-a-Judge baselines across both step and trajectory-level detection, demonstrating its effectiveness for both real-time guarding and post-hoc analysis. However, the framework's Formal Verifier is dependent on system state traces, limiting its direct applicability to closed environments like iOS, and while the simulated and frozen environments show strong closeness, inherent discrepancies from real-world dynamic conditions, such as random push notifications, remain a potential limitation.<br><br>"

A key strength is its use of a high-fidelity, robust autoencoder to compress K tokens into a single continuous vector, reducing generative steps and significantly improving the performance-compute trade-off, with empirical results showing CALM achieving baseline performance at substantially lower FLOPs and establishing semantic bandwidth (K) as a powerful new scaling axis. To facilitate this, CALM develops a comprehensive likelihood-free toolkit, including an energy-based generative head for efficient single-step prediction, the BrierLM metric for principled evaluation (demonstrably correlating with perplexity), and algorithms for likelihood-free temperature sampling. However, the continuous domain presents inherent challenges: the autoencoder requires complex regularization to produce a robust latent space, and the specialized likelihood-free methods replace conventional, more direct approaches. CALM's initial performance at K=1 lags discrete baselines, indicating room for architectural optimization, while effectively leveraging higher K values appears to demand larger model capacities. Additionally, the provably exact temperature sampling algorithm is computationally intensive, necessitating approximations, and direct continuous vector input to the Transformer backbone proved suboptimal, requiring token reconstruction for input.

              "**[Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26788)**<br>This research article argues that the instability plaguing reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), often attributed to a training-inference mismatch, primarily stems from the inherent low precision of the widely adopted BF16 floating-point format. The authors demonstrate that BF16's large rounding errors, despite its broad dynamic range, break consistency between training and inference policies. Their key strength lies in proposing a surprisingly simple yet highly effective solution: reverting to FP16. This change, requiring minimal code modification, is shown to virtually eliminate the mismatch, leading to significantly more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across various tasks, algorithms, frameworks, and model architectures (including MoE and LoRA). The paper effectively highlights how FP16's higher mantissa bits absorb numerical discrepancies, rendering complex algorithmic and engineering corrections largely unnecessary and closing the critical \"deployment gap.\" A primary weakness, acknowledged by the authors, is that FP16 might still present engineering challenges for *extremely* large models due to its comparatively limited dynamic range, even with loss scaling, implying it may not be a universally optimal solution for all scales. Additionally, while the paper effectively dismisses prior algorithmic fixes as inefficient or unstable under BF16, it doesn't deeply explore potential scenarios where such methods might still offer marginal benefits or address other forms of mismatch beyond precision.<br><br>"

              "  Matching within Subintervals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27684)**<br>Phased DMD offers a novel multi-step distillation framework designed to overcome the instability, memory overhead, and diversity loss associated with extending Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) to complex generative tasks. The method achieves this by integrating phase-wise distillation with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach, progressively refining models across Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) subintervals. A significant strength lies in its rigorous theoretical derivation of a score matching objective specifically for these subintervals, which allows for accurate training even without access to clean data samples in intermediate phases. This approach effectively preserves generative diversity and retains the base models' critical capabilities, such as precise text rendering and dynamic motion, outperforming prior distillation techniques like DMD with stochastic gradient truncation. While Phased DMD improves training stability and inherently produces an MoE generator, its impact on diversity can be marginal for base models that already have limited output diversity, and its current focus on the reverse KL divergence objective means its applicability to other distillation losses remains an area for future exploration.<br><br>"

A primary strength of HLA lies in its ability to capture higher-order, data-dependent interactions, offering greater expressivity than many first-order linear attention and State Space Models, by efficiently maintaining compact prefix sufficient statistics. For the second-order case, HLA provides linear-time per-token computation and maintains an O(d^2) constant-size state, while incorporating strictly causal masking through extended summaries and enabling exact chunk-parallel training via associative scans. The paper also outlines an asymmetric variant (AHLA) and extends the framework to third-order interactions. However, a notable weakness is the paper's exclusive focus on algorithmic structure and theoretical derivation, providing no empirical evaluation or performance benchmarks against existing long-context models, which limits an immediate assessment of its practical efficacy. Additionally, while the second-order parallel training is fully detailed, the complete chunk-parallel scan operator for the higher-order variants, specifically third-order, remains an area for future work, indicating an incomplete practical solution for these extensions.<br><br>"

Its core strength lies in explicitly maintaining separate processing streams for action and vision tokens while enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing through a multimodal diffusion transformer, coupled with a decoupled training algorithm that applies independent noise and flow-matching losses to each modality. This design effectively handles their inherent statistical differences, allowing the model to learn bidirectional causal relationships and achieve consistent, significant performance gains (up to 6% in simulation, 13% in real-world tasks) over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, including strong transfer learning capabilities from action-free video. Additionally, DUST introduces an asynchronous joint sampling method for test-time scaling, further boosting performance by 2-5%. However, a potential weakness is that this asynchronous scaling for improved visual refinement comes at the cost of increased inference time, and while the world model predicts rich semantic embeddings, it does not directly generate pixel-level future observations, which might limit some applications requiring explicit visual synthesis.<br><br>"

A key strength of BEAT is its two-stage training scheme, combining supervised fine-tuning with a new Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) approach that uses preference learning to sharpen decision boundaries around triggers. This method enables high attack success rates (up to 80%) across various benchmarks and MLLMs, maintains strong or even improved benign task performance, and effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution trigger placements while achieving near-zero false activations. CTL is particularly noted for boosting activation accuracy by up to 39% and demonstrating data efficiency. However, a weakness is that the full effectiveness of CTL was not evaluated on proprietary MLLMs like GPT-4o due to current API limitations, and one of the benchmarks (VAB-OmniGibson) relies on bounding box annotations for trigger objects, which could simplify detection compared to real-world, unconstrained scenarios, though another benchmark (EB-ALFRED) was box-free. Additionally, attack failures in some cases were attributed to difficulties in detecting small or partially obstructed triggers and challenges in fine-grained navigation.<br><br>"

A key strength of the study is its controlled experimental design, employing various reward functions and precise evaluation metrics to measure not only answer accuracy but also reasoning fidelity. However, the findings reveal significant limitations of RLVR: while it often improves evaluation metrics, it frequently does so by reinforcing superficial heuristics, exploiting formatting strategies, or re-weighting existing solutions, rather than by acquiring new, genuine reasoning capabilities. For instance, LIS tasks saw a collapse in intermediate reasoning with answer-only rewards, and even when sequence rewards improved accuracy on Activity Scheduling, models demonstrated a disconnect, often emitting superficial \"sorted\" prefaces that did not reliably drive the final optimal schedule. Furthermore, specific reward designs, like directly rewarding sorting, could backfire and hinder learning. The study itself acknowledges a limitation in its focus on a single base model and two specific tasks, suggesting that the generalizability of these observations across more diverse models or problem domains warrants further investigation. Ultimately, the work emphasizes that RLVR can lead to apparent task generalization without strengthening underlying reasoning, highlighting the critical need for benchmarks that clearly differentiate genuine mathematical competence from shortcut exploitation.<br><br>"
