This is achieved by projecting the residual connection space onto a specific manifold of doubly stochastic matrices, offering strong theoretical guarantees such as norm preservation and compositional closure, which prevent signal explosion or vanishing during training. Empirically, mHC demonstrates superior training stability, tangible performance improvements on various language model benchmarks, and robust scalability across different model sizes and training tokens. Crucially, the paper presents rigorous infrastructure-level optimizations, including kernel fusion, recomputing strategies, and an extended DualPipe schedule, ensuring these benefits are delivered with a remarkably low computational overhead, making mHC a practical and efficient solution for large-scale deep learning.</td>\n      <td>Despite its strengths, the practical implementation of mHC involves a complex infrastructure design that relies on highly specialized optimizations like custom kernel fusion, recomputing, and an extended DualPipe schedule. This level of engineering sophistication, leveraging tools like TileLang, might pose a significant barrier to adoption for researchers or organizations without similar dedicated resources and expertise. Furthermore, the manifold projection using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm provides an approximate solution to the doubly stochastic constraint, leading to minor deviations from ideal norm preservation in composite mappings, although these are shown to be bounded. While tested thoroughly on language models, the framework's generalizability across diverse deep learning domains beyond LLMs is not explicitly demonstrated, and the optimal choice of manifold constraints for different architectural needs remains an open area for future exploration.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table><br><br>"

Its key strengths lie in a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm, utilizing innovative \"evidence tokens\" for explicit event-level visual semantic capture, and a Factorized Preference Optimization (FPO) algorithm that explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding into the learning objective. The development of a factorized synthetic dataset to generate controlled dispreferred samples further supports this unique preference learning approach. This comprehensive framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding tasks, often with a more lightweight model, and its effectiveness is thoroughly validated through extensive ablation studies.</td>\n      <td>Despite its advancements, the model demonstrates limitations, showing modest F1 scores on certain complex tasks such as episodic memory and dense video captioning on YouCook2, which indicates areas for further improvement. Additionally, the factorized synthetic data generation primarily concentrates on creating negative (dis-preferred) samples, thereby lacking diversity in positive examples, a point acknowledged as future work.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table><br><br>"

The research introduces an effective three-stage training pipeline and a high-quality, large-scale instruction dataset, JavisInst-Omni, comprising over 200K GPT-4o-curated dialogues. JavisGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks, exhibiting superior quality, consistency, and synchrony, particularly in complex, temporally synchronized settings and interactive, multi-turn conversational scenarios.</td>\n      <td>Despite its advancements, JavisGPT exhibits architectural inconsistencies stemming from misaligned training objectives (next-token prediction for text, diffusion loss for audio-visual outputs) and an asymmetric input-output modeling approach that limits full mutual enhancement between comprehension and generation. The model's scalability is not fully explored, as it is built upon a 7B-scale LLM and limited public datasets. Furthermore, the current instruction-tuning lacks advanced post-training alignment techniques like reinforcement learning, which could further enhance generalization, complex reasoning, and output quality.

This innovation provides crucial guarantees for reproducibility, auditability, and safe deployment in applications like robotics, regulatory compliance, and decentralized AI. The paper provides empirical evidence of existing non-determinism and validates Valori's cross-platform consistency and high semantic fidelity (99.8% Recall@10) despite the numerical conversion, while also demonstrating how approximate nearest neighbor search can be made deterministic. Its configurable precision contracts and open-source implementation further enhance its utility and future adaptability.</td>\n      <td>Despite its innovative solution, Valori introduces certain trade-offs and has defined operational boundaries. The Q16.16 fixed-point arithmetic, while deterministic, inherently possesses a limited dynamic range and precision compared to floating-point numbers, which could potentially be an issue for extremely large or small vector components, although it is deemed adequate for normalized embeddings. Software-based fixed-point operations also incur a performance overhead compared to hardware-accelerated floating-point, though future work aims to mitigate this. Most significantly, Valori's determinism only applies *after* vectors enter the kernel, meaning it does not address or guarantee the determinism of the neural network inference process itself (e.g., embedding generation), leaving this as an open problem for the broader AI field.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table><br><br>"

This approach emphasizes capturing symbolic visual meaning, similar to how humans reason over sketches, as an alternative to dense pixel-based representations. VCode repurposes existing benchmarks across commonsense, professional knowledge, and visual-centric perception domains. To evaluate symbolic fidelity, the authors propose CodeVQA, where a policy model answers questions based on the rendered SVG. Empirically, frontier Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate limitations in generating faithful SVGs. To address this, the paper presents VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs with iterative revision (thinking with revision) and external perception tools (acting with visual tools). VCoder achieves significant performance gains over strong baselines, yet human studies and experimental results highlight persistent challenges in bridging the gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding, particularly in complex domains like professional knowledge and 3D reasoning.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Strength</th>\n      <th>Weakness</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>VCode introduces a novel and challenging perspective on multimodal understanding, framing it as SVG code generation to capture symbolic visual meaning, which moves beyond traditional pixel-based representations. The benchmark includes diverse domains (commonsense, professional, vision-centric) and a robust evaluation protocol (CodeVQA) specifically designed to assess symbolic fidelity. VCoder provides an effective solution by augmenting VLMs with iterative revision and external visual tools, significantly improving SVG generation accuracy and demonstrating a pathway to bridge the gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. The research provides insights through human studies, suggesting alignment between human and VLM reasoning over symbolic representations, and the project is open-sourced, facilitating further research.</td>\n      <td>Despite advancements, a substantial performance gap remains between the best SVG generation results and reasoning over original raw images, indicating that SVG may not yet fully capture all necessary visual information for complex tasks. The task of faithful SVG generation from natural images is highly challenging for frontier VLMs, requiring management of long code contexts and precise low-level detail encoding, which currently limits their intrinsic capabilities. VCoder's reliance on external visual tools (e.g., object detectors, segmenters) highlights that VLMs currently lack the intrinsic fine-grained perception needed for detailed code generation, potentially limiting end-to-end learning. Models show particular struggle with domains requiring professional knowledge and 3D reasoning, suggesting limitations in abstract or complex spatial representation via SVG. The observation that converting images to linguistic captions *before* SVG generation often outperforms direct image-to-SVG approaches implies that language still acts as a critical intermediate representation, rather than models directly \"thinking\" in visual code.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</html>\n```<br><br>"

Through a carefully constructed controllable \"toy\" dataset that systematically varies visual and textual difficulty, the study empirically establishes a universal law: the probability of an MLLM following a specific modality monotonically decreases as its relative reasoning uncertainty increases. This allows for a principled quantification of a model's inherent preference as a \"balance point,\" effectively disentangling it from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts, a significant strength over prior coarse dataset-level statistics. Furthermore, the paper provides mechanistic insight by revealing that models exhibit internal \"oscillations\" between conflicting answers across layers when operating in ambiguous regions near this balance point, explaining observed external hesitation. While the use of a controlled \"toy\" dataset is crucial for isolating variables and revealing these fundamental principles, its simplicity, focusing primarily on color and attribution tasks, might limit the direct generalizability of the specific balance points or oscillation patterns to more complex, real-world multimodal scenarios or diverse reasoning tasks.

This methodical approach leads to state-of-the-art performance across multiple complex numerical reasoning benchmarks, including TAT-QA, TableBench, and the novel CALTAB151 dataset, which was specifically created to mitigate data leakage and ensure unbiased evaluation. Furthermore, TABDSR demonstrates strong transferability, proving effective not only with smaller LLMs but also enhancing the performance of highly capable models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, while its prompt-based design lowers barriers to adoption by minimizing the need for extensive fine-tuning or specialized training.</td>\n      <td>Despite its advancements, TABDSR exhibits several limitations. Its performance, being a prompt-only method, remains ultimately constrained by the underlying LLM's reasoning abilities, falling short of human-level performance in complex numerical reasoning tasks. The CALTAB151 dataset, a valuable contribution for unbiased evaluation, is relatively small with only 151 samples and limited in question type diversity and domains due to the high costs associated with manual verification during its construction. The Query Decomposer, by strictly operating on the question text and ignoring table context, can occasionally degrade performance in cases where table signals are crucial for effective decomposition, representing a pragmatic trade-off for robustness. Moreover, the Table Sanitizer is limited by the base model's reflection capabilities, sometimes resulting in persistent errors and inefficient, redundant calls, while the PoT-based Reasoner (Executor) module experiences a notable failure rate of 15-17% due to various code execution errors like ValueError, KeyError, and TypeError, highlighting ongoing challenges in generating universally robust and correct code for diverse tabular inputs.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table><br><br>"

The authors systematically show that existing supervised and reinforcement fine-tuned models lack self-awareness, leading to misaligned confidence and actual accuracy, analogous to LLM hallucination, which is detrimental in dynamic GUI automation tasks. HyperClick proposes a novel framework that enhances reliability through uncertainty calibration, introducing a dual reward mechanism combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence model, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering introspective self-criticism. Strengths include achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging benchmarks, providing well-calibrated confidence that reduces overconfidence and supports safer decision-making, outperforming larger GUI-specific models, and demonstrating a \"plug-and-play\" capability for integration with different foundation models. A noted weakness is that the framework has not yet been extended to GUI planning tasks, where the reliability of multi-step decisions is even more crucial.<br><br>"

The authors demonstrate that BF16's large rounding errors, despite its broad dynamic range, break consistency between training and inference policies. Their key strength lies in proposing a surprisingly simple yet highly effective solution: reverting to FP16. This change, requiring minimal code modification, is shown to virtually eliminate the mismatch, leading to significantly more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across various tasks, algorithms, frameworks, and model architectures (including MoE and LoRA). The paper effectively highlights how FP16's higher mantissa bits absorb numerical discrepancies, rendering complex algorithmic and engineering corrections largely unnecessary and closing the critical \"deployment gap.\" A primary weakness, acknowledged by the authors, is that FP16 might still present engineering challenges for *extremely* large models due to its comparatively limited dynamic range, even with loss scaling, implying it may not be a universally optimal solution for all scales. Additionally, while the paper effectively dismisses prior algorithmic fixes as inefficient or unstable under BF16, it doesn't deeply explore potential scenarios where such methods might still offer marginal benefits or address other forms of mismatch beyond precision.<br><br>"

The method achieves this by integrating phase-wise distillation with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach, progressively refining models across Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) subintervals. A significant strength lies in its rigorous theoretical derivation of a score matching objective specifically for these subintervals, which allows for accurate training even without access to clean data samples in intermediate phases. This approach effectively preserves generative diversity and retains the base models' critical capabilities, such as precise text rendering and dynamic motion, outperforming prior distillation techniques like DMD with stochastic gradient truncation. While Phased DMD improves training stability and inherently produces an MoE generator, its impact on diversity can be marginal for base models that already have limited output diversity, and its current focus on the reverse KL divergence objective means its applicability to other distillation losses remains an area for future exploration.<br><br>"

This design effectively handles their inherent statistical differences, allowing the model to learn bidirectional causal relationships and achieve consistent, significant performance gains (up to 6% in simulation, 13% in real-world tasks) over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, including strong transfer learning capabilities from action-free video. Additionally, DUST introduces an asynchronous joint sampling method for test-time scaling, further boosting performance by 2-5%.

A key strength of BEAT is its two-stage training scheme, combining supervised fine-tuning with a new Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) approach that uses preference learning to sharpen decision boundaries around triggers. This method enables high attack success rates (up to 80%) across various benchmarks and MLLMs, maintains strong or even improved benign task performance, and effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution trigger placements while achieving near-zero false activations. CTL is particularly noted for boosting activation accuracy by up to 39% and demonstrating data efficiency. However, a weakness is that the full effectiveness of CTL was not evaluated on proprietary MLLMs like GPT-4o due to current API limitations, and one of the benchmarks (VAB-OmniGibson) relies on bounding box annotations for trigger objects, which could simplify detection compared to real-world, unconstrained scenarios, though another benchmark (EB-ALFRED) was box-free.

A key strength of the study is its controlled experimental design, employing various reward functions and precise evaluation metrics to measure not only answer accuracy but also reasoning fidelity. However, the findings reveal significant limitations of RLVR: while it often improves evaluation metrics, it frequently does so by reinforcing superficial heuristics, exploiting formatting strategies, or re-weighting existing solutions, rather than by acquiring new, genuine reasoning capabilities. For instance, LIS tasks saw a collapse in intermediate reasoning with answer-only rewards, and even when sequence rewards improved accuracy on Activity Scheduling, models demonstrated a disconnect, often emitting superficial \"sorted\" prefaces that did not reliably drive the final optimal schedule. Furthermore, specific reward designs, like directly rewarding sorting, could backfire and hinder learning. The study itself acknowledges a limitation in its focus on a single base model and two specific tasks, suggesting that the generalizability of these observations across more diverse models or problem domains warrants further investigation. Ultimately, the work emphasizes that RLVR can lead to apparent task generalization without strengthening underlying reasoning, highlighting the critical need for benchmarks that clearly differentiate genuine mathematical competence from shortcut exploitation.<br><br>"
