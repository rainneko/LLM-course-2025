            "\n",
            "**1. Zero-Shot Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Present the model with a task and its input without any examples.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To see if the model can generalize and perform the task directly.\n",
            "   * **Example:** \"Translate this to French: 'Hello, how are you?'\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Few-Shot Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Provide the model with a few examples of input-output pairs before presenting the actual task.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To guide the model towards the desired output format and style.\n",
            "   * **Example:**\n",
            "     * \"English: Cat, French: Chat\n",
            "     * English: Dog, French: Chien\n",
            "     * English: Bird, French: ?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Encourage the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step before arriving at the final answer.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To improve performance on complex reasoning tasks and make the model's process transparent.\n",
            "   * **Example:** \"Q: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many does he have left? A: John starts with 5 apples. He gives away 2 apples. So, 5 - 2 = 3. John has 3 apples left.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Self-Consistency:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Generate multiple CoT responses for the same prompt and choose the most frequent answer.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To enhance accuracy and robustness by averaging out potential errors in individual reasoning paths.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Role Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Instruct the model to act as a specific persona or entity.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To tailor the response style, tone, and knowledge to a particular context.\n",
            "   * **Example:** \"You are a seasoned travel blogger. Describe the best places to visit in Kyoto.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. Instruction Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Clearly and explicitly state what you want the model to do.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To ensure the model understands the objective and avoids ambiguity.\n",
            "   * **Example:** \"Summarize the following article in three bullet points.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. Constraint-Based Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Specify limitations or rules for the model's output.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To control the length, format, or content of the response.\n",
            "   * **Example:** \"Write a poem about the ocean, no more than 8 lines long and rhyming AABB.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**8. Generated Knowledge Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** Ask the model to first generate relevant knowledge about a topic, then use that knowledge to answer a question.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** To help the model access and synthesize information it might not directly possess.\n",
            "   * **Example:** \"First, explain the concept of photosynthesis. Then, answer: What is the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**9. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting:**\n",
            "   * **Description:** A more advanced form of CoT that explores multiple reasoning paths and evaluates them to find the best solution.\n",
            "   * **Purpose:** For highly complex problems where branching exploration is beneficial.\n",
